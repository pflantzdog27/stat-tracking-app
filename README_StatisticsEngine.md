# Statistics Calculation Backend

A comprehensive statistics engine for hockey team management with advanced calculations, caching, and real-time capabilities.

## Overview

The Statistics Calculation Backend provides a complete solution for aggregating individual game statistics into season totals, calculating derived metrics, and handling position-specific statistics with performance optimization and intelligent caching.

## Core Components

### ðŸ§® Statistics Engine (`statistics-engine.ts`)
The core calculation engine that aggregates game events into meaningful statistics.

**Key Features:**
- **Event Aggregation**: Converts game events into player statistics
- **Position-Specific Calculations**: Different stat calculations for Forwards, Defense, and Goalies
- **Team Statistics**: Comprehensive team-level metrics and standings
- **Real-time Updates**: Efficient recalculation when game events change
- **Flexible Filtering**: Date ranges, situational strength, home/away splits

**Core Methods:**
```typescript
// Get complete player statistics
async getPlayerStats(playerId, teamId, season, options): PlayerStatsComplete

// Aggregate raw game events into base stats
async aggregatePlayerStats(playerId, teamId, season): BasePlayerStats

// Calculate team-level statistics
async getTeamStats(teamId, season): TeamStats
```
